# EGU Student Planner - Mobile App - Maui, C#
This is my mobile application for letting students plan their school terms. By logging in, students can create a schedule for the term, and add courses to it.
They can also view relevant information about the courses, such as the course description, and the professor's name. As well as exam information, such as the date and time of the exam with notifications for when the exam is coming up.
  
  This app is built using Maui for cross-platform operation such as Android and iOS. It is purely fictional, and is not affiliated with any real school or university.

## How to install app using APK file
Since the app is not officially released on neither the apple store nor the google play store, an ad hoc installation will be necessary.

<strong>For Windows (Android Emulation):</strong>  
1. First install an Android emulator of your choice. 
1. Then setup an android virtual device. 
1. Drag and drop the APK file to the emulator to install and run it.
